-------

This style file was originally written by John Sleath and Tim Jenness
at the Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in the summer of 1995. It
was derived from the astron.bst style file which itself was derived
from the apalike.bst style file.

Norman Gray provided the multi-author style fixes.
