% The following three macros provide auxiliary support for the BibTeX
% wranglings in mn2e.bst.  They provide support for functionality
% which it is impossible, or at least unmaintainably arcane, to
% provide within BibTeX Style Language.
%
% These definitions can be loaded as a package or, probably better,
% should be incorporated into a mn2e.cls file.



% \mniiiauthor
%
% The following implements the three-author-hack described in mn2e.bst.
%
% This consumes a command for each such author.  It's surely possible
% to avoid this (with some constructions involving {\\#1}; see
% Appendix D cleverness), but that would verge on the unmaintanably
% arcane, and not be really worth it.
